This directory acts as a replacement for the original MultiMarkdown directory
from version 2.0.

MMD version 3 is a single binary, but for more complicated setups some users
may like to use the XSLT features from version 2 for more customization.

For now, this feature is unsupported, and for "experts only." Once it's
finished, the instructions will be improved, and I will be able to offer
better support for it.

In general, the scripts in `MultiMarkdown/bin` act as shortcuts to the binary
with certain command-line options to emulate the behavior of the old
convenience scripts. The files in `MultiMarkdown/XSLT` are modifications to
the original XSLT files that work with MMD version 3. So now, in fact, there
are two routes to convert MMD into LaTeX --- one is to use `multimarkdown -t
latex`, and the other is to use the `mmd2xslt` script to convert MMD into
XHTML and then into LaTeX by applying an XSLT file. This second route is
significantly slower, and slightly more complicated, and requires that the
XSLT files be in the right place; it does, however, offer a greater level of
customization for MultiMarkdown "experts."
